# Multifactor_Model
This project was undertaken as a part of AI for Trading Nanodegree Term 1 from Udacity.

The goal of this project was to build a statistical risk model using PCA and to use this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. 
After creating these factors, evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, Sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. 
At the end of the project, the portfolio was to be optimized using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. 
The dataset used was the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

Used python's convex optimization (cvxpy), zipline, numpy and pandas packages to achieve the goal.
