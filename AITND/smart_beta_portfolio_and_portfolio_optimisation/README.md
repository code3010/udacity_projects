# Smart Beta Portfolio and Portfolio Optimisation
This project was undertaken as a part of AI for Trading Nanodegree Term 1 from Udacity.

The goal of this project was to build a smart beta portfolio and compare it to a benchmark index to find out
how well the smart beta portfolio did by calculating the tracking error against the index.
Then build a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights.
The code will rebalance this portfolio and calculate turn over to evaluate the performance.
This metric will be used to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency.
The dataset used was the end of day from Quotemedia.

Used python's convex optimization (cvxpy), numpy and pandas packages to achieve the goal.
