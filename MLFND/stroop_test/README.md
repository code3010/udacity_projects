# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon (Stroop Test)
This project was undertaken as a part of Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree from Udacity.

The goal of this project was to test a perceptual phenomenon viz. stroop effect.

Used matplotlib for visualisation and python's pandas library to load the dataset and compute descriptive statistics 
to provide an intuition about the data, and inferential statistics (dependent t-test for paired samples) 
to draw a conclusion based on the results.
